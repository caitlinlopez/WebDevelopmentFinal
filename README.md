# Web Development I Final
For our 9th grade web development final, we worked in pairs to make a project that incorporated various web development concepts we had learned throughout the year.
My partner and I decided to make virtual "shops" with custom art I created. One shop has videos you could watch, embedded into the page. Another has music embedded into the page.
Lastly, one of the shops is an arcade, and contains 3 games the user can play. I included the snake game I made earlier in the year as one of the 3, and the other 2 games used
code I found online.
